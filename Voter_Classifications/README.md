Voter Support Classification on Government Fiscal Responsibility

In this project, a hundred anonymized features are given to predict whether a voter is likely to support higher government spending versus reducing the national debt when given a choice. The provided data contain survey responses from 20,000 randomly selected individuals across the country. There are two responses: Spend to Improve Economy (represented by 1) or Reduce National Debt and Deficit (represented by 0). The goal of this project is to predict the responses for 29,231 voters.
