# Wine-Quality-Classification-
Wine quality is important for both wine producers and consumers. In this project, models are built for wine quality classification. Data exploration analysis is done for input data. Several models are built on the processed data, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine, KNN and XGBoost. An ensemble model is built by combing these models as the final solution for classification. 
This is a 5 hour data hackson exercise.
